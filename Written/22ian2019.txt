1) checked vs unchecked Exceptions

 Checked: are the exceptions that are checked at compile time. 
If some code within a method throws a checked exception, 
then the method must either handle the exception or it must specify the exception using throws keyword.

 Unchecked are the exceptions that are not checked at compiled time.
In Java exceptions under Error and RuntimeException classes are unchecked exceptions, everything else under throwable is checked.

Cyclic Barrier

It is a barrier that all threads must wait at, until
all threads reach it, before any of the threads
can continue.
