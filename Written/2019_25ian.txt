Overriding vs overloading

Method overloading is performed within class.
Method overriding occurs in two classes that have inheritance relationship.
In case of method overloading, parameter must be different.
In case of method overriding, parameter must be same.

CountDown

countDown() method.Threads waiting for this count to reach zero
can call one of the await() methods. Calling
await() blocks the thread until the count
reaches zero.
