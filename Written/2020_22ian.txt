Semaphore

the java.util.concurrent.Semaphore class is a counting
semaphore.
 The counting semaphore is initialized with a given
number of "permits".
 For each call to acquire() a permit is taken by the calling
thread.
 For each call to release() a permit is returned to the
semaphore.
 Thus, at most N threads can pass the acquire() method
without any release() calls, where N is the number of
permits the semaphore was initialized with.
